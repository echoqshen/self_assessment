### What I Have Accomplished

### Team assessment
##### Stength
The strength of a great team is to be able to listen and learn from each other.
##### Challenges
- I learned from working on a group project that the biggest challenge is to have a strong leader which I felt the team fell short on. 
- Having a clear direction and defining the expected outcome at the very start is also extremely crucial. There were many conflicting opinions on how best to approach the overall project, even at the very late stage. 
- I felt like there was lack of participation overall from all parties or cohesive teamwork.
